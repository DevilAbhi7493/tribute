        <h1>Chandra Shekhar Azad</h1>

        <p>Chandra Shekhar Tiwari ( 23 July 1906 – 27 February 1931), popularly known as
            Chandra Shekhar Azad, was an Indian revolutionary who reorganised the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA)
            under its new name of Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) after the death of its founder, Ram
            Prasad Bismil, and three other prominent party leaders, Roshan Singh, Rajendra Nath Lahiri and Ashfaqulla
            Khan. He hailed from Bardarka village in Unnao district of United Provinces and his parents were Sitaram
            Tiwari and Jagrani Devi. He often used the pseudonym "Balraj" while signing pamphlets issued as the
            commander-in-chief of the HSRA.
        </p>
        <h1>Early life and career</h1>
        <p>Chandra Shekhar Azad was born on 23 July 1906 in Bhabhra village as Chandra Shekhar Tiwari, in a Brahmin
            family, in the princely-state of Alirajpur. His forefathers were from Badarka village of Unnao district of
            Uttar Pradesh. His mother, Jagrani Devi, was the third wife of Sitaram Tiwari, whose previous wives had died
            young. After the birth of their first son, Sukhdev, in Badarka, the family moved to Alirajpur State.
            His mother wanted her son to be a great Sanskrit scholar and persuaded his father to send him to Kashi
            Vidyapeeth at Benares to study. In 1921, when the Non-Cooperation Movement was at its height, Chandra
            Shekhar, then a 15-year-old student, joined. As a result, he was arrested on 20 December. On being presented
            before the Parsi district magistrate Justice M. P. Khareghat a week later, he gave his name as "Azad" (The
            Free), his father's name as "Swatantrata" (Independence) and his residence as "Jail". The angered magistrate
            punished him with 15 lashes.

        <h1>Revolutionary life </h1>
        <p>
            After the suspension of the non-cooperation movement in 1922 by Mahatma Gandhi, Azad became disappointed. He
            met a young revolutionary, Manmath Nath Gupta, who introduced him to Ram Prasad Bismil who had formed the
            Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), a revolutionary organization. He then became an active member of the
            HRA and started to collect funds for HRA. Most of the fund collection was through robberies of government
            property. He was involved in the Kakori Train Robbery of 1925, the shooting of John P. Saunders at Lahore in
            1928 to avenge the killing of Lala Lajpat Rai, and at last, in the attempt to blow up the Viceroy of India's
            train in 1929.
        </p>
        <h1>Death</h1>
        <p>On 27 February 1931, the CID head of the police at Allahabad, J. R. H. Nott-Bower was tipped off by someone
            that Azad was at Alfred Park and was having a talk with his companion and aide Sukhdev Raj. On receiving it,
            Bower called on the Allahabad Police to accompany him to the park to arrest him. Azad's old comrades Veer
            Bhadra Tiwari and Yashpal were also held responsible for tipping off two of the police constables. The
            police arrived at the park and surrounded it from all four sides. Some constables along with DSP Thakur
            Vishweshwar Singh entered the park armed with rifles and the shootout began. Azad killed three policemen but
            was badly wounded in the process of defending himself and helping his colleague Raj.
            After a long shootout, holding true to his pledge to always remain Azad (Free) and never be captured alive,
            he shot himself in the head with his gun's last bullet
